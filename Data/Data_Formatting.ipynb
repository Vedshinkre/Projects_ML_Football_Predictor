    "## Predictor Groups  \n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Baseline Predictors (Static Factors)  \n",
    "The first group consists of fundamental predictors that are **easily accessible before a match** and have a significant impact on game results. These include:  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Venue_code** – Encodes whether a team is playing home or away.  \n",
    "- **Opp_code** – Represents the opponent team.  \n",
    "- **Hour** – The match start time, which can influence player performance.  \n",
    "- **Day_code** – Encodes the day of the week, considering potential rest and preparation effects.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Rolling Averages (Performance-Based Predictors)  \n",
    "The second group expands on the first by integrating **rolling averages** of key performance indicators. These provide a **dynamic perspective** by capturing recent form and trends:  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **GF_rolling** – Rolling average of goals scored.  \n",
    "- **GA_rolling** – Rolling average of goals conceded.  \n",
    "- **Sh_rolling** – Rolling average of total shots taken.  \n",
    "- **SoT_rolling** – Rolling average of shots on target.  \n",
    "- **PK_rolling** – Rolling average of penalties scored.  \n",
    "- **PKatt_rolling** – Rolling average of penalty attempts.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Full Feature Set (Rank-Based Enhancement)  \n",
    "The third group includes **all previous predictors** while adding **ranking-based insights**, further refining predictive power:  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Rank** – The FIFA club ranking of the team.  \n",
    "- **IsRanked** – A binary indicator of whether the team appears in FIFA club rankings.  \n",
    "\n",
    "By progressively incorporating these predictor groups, we aim to analyze their **individual and combined impacts** on match outcome prediction accuracy. This approach ensures a **structured and data-driven methodology**, balancing both static match conditions and dynamic team performance trends.  \n"

    "## 1. Baseline Predictors (Static Factors)¶  \n",
    "\n",
    "Before using these predictors in our model, we need to **properly format and encode** them to ensure they are suitable for machine learning. The baseline predictors include **Venue_code, Opp_code, Hour, and Day_code**, which provide valuable pre-match context. These features influence match outcomes by capturing factors such as **home advantage, opponent strength, match timing, and scheduling effects**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "To enhance their utility, we will **convert categorical variables into numerical representations** where necessary, ensuring that our model can effectively process and analyze them. This structured approach lays the groundwork for incorporating more advanced predictors in later stages."
