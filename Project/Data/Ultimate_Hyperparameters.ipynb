    "# 🔧 Understanding Hyperparameters in Machine Learning Models  \n",
    "\n",
    "## What Are Hyperparameters?  \n",
    "Hyperparameters are **configurable parameters** set before a machine learning model begins training. Unlike model parameters (e.g., weights in neural networks), hyperparameters **are not learned from the data** but are instead manually specified or optimized using techniques like **grid search** or **random search**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Do We Need Hyperparameters?  \n",
    "Hyperparameters play a crucial role in determining the **performance, speed, and generalization** of a model. Choosing the right hyperparameters can:  \n",
    "- Improve **accuracy** and **efficiency**  \n",
    "- Prevent **overfitting** (learning noise instead of patterns)  \n",
    "- Enhance **generalization** to unseen data  \n",
    "- Speed up **training and inference**  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Examples of Hyperparameters in Different Models  \n",
    "Here are some common hyperparameters across different models:  \n",
    "\n",
    "### 🏆 Decision Trees & Random Forests  \n",
    "- `max_depth`: Controls tree depth to prevent overfitting  \n",
    "- `min_samples_split`: Minimum samples required to split a node  \n",
    "- `n_estimators` (for ensembles): Number of trees in a forest  \n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔥 Neural Networks  \n",
    "- `learning_rate`: Defines how fast the model updates weights  \n",
    "- `batch_size`: Number of training samples per batch  \n",
    "- `epochs`: Number of complete passes through the dataset  \n",
    "\n",
    "### 📈 Gradient Boosting (XGBoost, LightGBM)  \n",
    "- `learning_rate`: Controls the contribution of each tree  \n",
    "- `n_estimators`: Number of boosting rounds  \n",
    "- `max_depth`: Limits tree depth to prevent overfitting  \n",
    "\n",
    "## What Is the \"Perfect\" Hyperparameter Value?  \n",
    "There is **no universal perfect value** for hyperparameters. The optimal settings depend on:  \n",
    "- The **dataset** size and complexity  \n",
    "- The **model type** and architecture  \n",
    "- The **goal** (e.g., maximizing accuracy vs. minimizing inference time)  \n",
    "\n",
    "To find the best hyperparameters, we use:  \n",
    "✅ **Grid Search**: Tests all combinations of hyperparameters  \n",
    "✅ **Random Search**: Randomly samples hyperparameters for efficiency  \n",
    "✅ **Bayesian Optimization**: Selects hyperparameters based on past results  \n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔍 Conclusion  \n",
    "Hyperparameters **define how a model learns**, impacting its **accuracy, speed, and generalization**. Proper tuning is essential for achieving **optimal performance** without overfitting or underfitting.  \n"

    "## **1. Pruning in Classification Tree**  \n",
    "Pruning helps prevent **overfitting** by reducing the size of a decision tree, leading to improved accuracy on unseen data. Without pruning, a tree may **memorize** training data rather than generalizing well to new data.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **Post-Pruning (Cost Complexity Pruning - CCP)**  \n",
    "In post-pruning, the tree is first grown to full depth (even if it overfits) and then gradually pruned by removing nodes based on a complexity parameter α .  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### **How CCP Works?**  \n",
    "The pruning process minimizes the following equation:  \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{Total Cost} = \\text{RSS} + \\alpha \\times \\text{Number of Leaves}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **RSS (Residual Sum of Squares)** measures the error in predictions.  \n",
    "- **α** is a tuning parameter that controls the trade-off between tree complexity and error.  \n",
    "  - **Higher α** → More pruning → Simpler tree.  \n",
    "  - **Lower α** → Less pruning → More complex tree.  \n",
    "- The value for **α** can be found using cross validation.\n"

    "### How to Find the Best k?\n",

    "✅ **A balanced k-value** prevents both overfitting (high variance) and underfitting (high bias).  \n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### **How C Affects the Model:**  \n",
    "- **High C (Hard Margin SVM)**:  \n",
    "  - Enforces strict classification with fewer misclassified points.  \n",
